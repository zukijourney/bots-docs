# zukijourney-bots

zukijourney offers a large set of discord bots! Having started from simply `zuki.gm` -- it has grown into an enterprise of size 8.
However, the original, `.gm` -- still remains #1, by far!

See it for yourself below :)

# zuki.gm

zuki.gm is a Discord bot specially designed to aid NationRP (Nation RolePlay) and TraditionalRP (Traditional RolePlay) communities. It's not just limited to this, but also offers various creativity tools, AI image tools, writing tools, and even NRP tools. This bot is unfortunately not open source, due to its large codebase, and relative security risks of public reveal. Currently, zuki.gm has served over 31000 unique users and is operational in over 1600 servers.

## Core Features

### AI GameMaster
- The AI GameMaster is accessed using `!gm` or `/gm` commands.
- It takes in categories like political reform (`pol`), economic reform (`eco`), military reform (`mil`), war operations (`war`), NPC responses (`npc`), espionage moves (`esp`), and meme moves (`fun`).
- It can not only generate responses but also react to roleplay posts with realistic texture.

### The Revise System
- The `Revise` system is a form of reinforcement learning from human feedback encapsulated within a command.
- This system allows users to provide feedback about what the AI missed during its processing or what it should change in order to improve its future interactions.

### Additional Tools
- `/save` command allows you to store server lore for more accurate outputs.
- `/war` provides a war simulation environment.
- `/realism` assesses the realism of your inputs.

## AI-powered Image Tools

### AI Image Generation
- `/sd` command allows you to generate different styles of images powered by AI.
- For unfiltered image generation, use `/sdx-v1` or `/sdx-v2`.

### AI Image Analysis
- `/interpret` allows the AI to analyze an image and generate a descriptive output of what it sees.

### AI Video/Music Creation
- `/sd-clip` generates video or music using AI based on your selected theme.

## AI-powered Writing Tools

### AI Writing
- `/write` helps the AI write anything you wish, be it creating an RP post, outlining ideas, conducting research, or even creating an event.
- Server-context stored using the `/save` command applies to this tool as well.

### AI Assistance
- Using `/ask`, you can ask a set of bots anything.
- With `/translate`, you can translate text into different languages.

### AI Text Tools
- `/check` inspects whether a given post was written by the AI.
- `/tldr` generates a summarization of any long post.
- `/tts` generates a text-to-speech output.

### UN tools
- `/un` command provides several tools to facilitate the roleplay of acting as the United Nations Secretary General.

## NRP Tools
- `/growth` calculates population growth.
- `/call` and `/hangup` helps to manage threads for direct communication with other users.

## Performance Stats & Metrics
- Currently supporting 31000 unique users.
- Present in over 1600 servers.
- A 90% uptime since March 2023, the origin of the project.
